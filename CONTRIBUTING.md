# Contribution Guidelines

We very much hope to incorporate community work into Ele, and if you're looking
to help out, thank you very much!

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes in a well-named topic branch.
3. Submit your pull request. Reference an existing issue if it's related to one.

## Guidelines

1. Check out [the issues page](https://github.com/divshot/ele-web/issues) to see
   if there's any existing discussion about your planned contribution. This is
   also obviously a great way to find things to work on!
2. For bugfixes or work on existing reported issues, feel free to just jump on
   in! Make a pull request and ship it!
3. For new features, UI changes, etc, we encourage you to start a quick
   discussion on the issues page first. This is just to save you the trouble of
   submitting a pull request for something that we feel doesn't mesh well with
   our vision for Ele.
   
That's it! Go forth and contribute!
