    <p class="lead">Ele (pronounced "Ellie") is a browser-based editing environment centered on creating reusable custom elements compatible with the Web Components specifications.</p>
      
    <marked-element>
## Component Editor
      
The heart of Ele is the Component Editor, a simple "fiddle-esque" environment for building custom elements. The component editor has three main pieces:
      
1. **Element Source Panel:** This is where you will write the actual source code for your custom element. For now, Ele is designed around creating elements based on the [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) library. We hope to expand this in the near future to support X-Tags as well as vanilla custom elements.
2. **Demo Source Panel:** The demo source panel is where you will showcase the usage of your custom element. A good demo will help people immediately understand what your element can do as well as some of the basic options for it.
3. **Preview Panel:** This is a live-updating preview of your element's demo. As you change the source in either of the other two panels, this will automatically update.
      
Your code is continuously saved while you work.
      
### Element Package Name
      
Ele will automatically name your package based on the first `polymer-element` you define in it. When you create a new element it will be assigned a random name, and the name will be updated whenever you change it in the source.
      
### Using Imported Elements
      
Ele is designed to mirror as closely as possible environment of a reusable component distributed via Bower. To that end, we have made available Polymer, the `core-elements` and the `paper-elements` by using relative URLs. For example, if you want to use `core-ajax` in your element, you simply need to add the relevant `<link>` tag:
      
    <link rel="import" href="../core-ajax/core-ajax.html">

For now only the core and paper elements are available for import; however, we have hopes of making fully customizable bower dependencies a reality for Ele in the near future.
      
**Note:** You should make sure to leave the `polymer.html` import in your source, as you will need it to be able to define a `polymer-element`.
      
### Documenting Your Element
      
Ele allows you to write documentation for your element directly into the source code. Utilizing Polymer's [core-doc-viewer](http://www.polymer-project.org/components/core-doc-viewer/demo.html), Ele will automatically parse Markdown comments in your element to turn them into documentation, which is visible on your element's public page.

    <marked-element id="public">
## Sharing Elements
      
At any time you can click the **Share Button** in the editor toolbar to open the public page for your element. The public page shows a read-only version of your source code along-side your demo and any documentation parsed out from the comments in your source code. You can share a link to your element's public page. The public page reflects the most recent save of an element.
      
For now, sharing an element simply serves as a good way to quickly view the source code and a live demo of a custom element. In the future we plan to make it possible to tag versioned releases of an element and even publish it to Bower!

## Ele Roadmap
      
Ele is an [open source](https://github.com/divshot/ele-web) community effort by [Divshot](http://www.divshot.com/). We hope to create a fast, easy-to-use environment for quickly crafting reusable Web Components. To that end, here are some of the features we have planned:
      
* **Bower Dependencies:** We aim to make it possible to specify Bower dependencies for your element so that you can have a truly local-esque environment for working on your elements.
* **Publish to Gist:** You will be able to publish your element to a Gist (including publishing new versions of that element).
* **Bower Installable:** Custom elements hosted on Ele will be able to be installed (with semantic versioning) via Bower, making it not just a playground but a feasible element distribution platform!
* **Browseable Directory:** Any element with a published release will be put into a browseable element catalog.
* **Beyond Polymer:** We want to make sure that Ele is compatible with any custom element libraries, not just Polymer.

Is there something you'd love to see that we haven't thought of yet? Let us know on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/divshot/ele-web/issues).
